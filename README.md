## Code Compilation Instructions

To run the two data processing pipelines, ensure that Python and Spark are setup on the system. Put the raw data file in a folder named <b>data</b>. Run the following lines in the shell

`$ python3 data_prcs.py`<br>
`$ python3 ml_prcs.py`

## Instructions to run
Place the contents of the processed data folder in `backend\ProcessedData` folder.

### Backend
npm i\
npm run start-backend

### Frontend
cd waterfinder\
npm i\
npm run start-frontend

## Member Contributions
All the authors of this report had equal contributions in the creation of this project. Vishvaditya came up with the original idea for the project. He also worked on creating the data processing pipelines in PySpark along with training the machine learning model. The corresponding sections to those topics present in this report are also written by him as well. He also worked on creating the layout of the project proposal presentation and set up the initial draft of the project proposal report. The evaluation for the data processing pipelines and the prediction model were also carried out by Vishvaditya. <br>
<br>
Jiahua conducted in-depth research on groundwater challenges, synthesizing insights from literature to define project goals and implementation strategies. He reviewed prior studies on groundwater management and prediction, identifying relevant techniques and methods to address project challenges. Also integrated key technical approaches into the project by synthesizing findings from prior research. Jiahua also contributed to part of the initial project report and presentation, providing a clear framework for team discussions and refinements. He also helped to build the web application leveraging modern web technologies to enable seamless visualization and analysis of groundwater well data, ensuring an engaging and efficient user experience.<br>

Seokha designed and implemented a user-friendly web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and NodeJS) for interactive visualization and analysis of groundwater well data. He worked on improving the applicationâ€™s responsiveness and scalability by implementing a marker clustering strategy, reducing rendering times for large datasets. He conducted performance comparisons between MongoDB and CSV data fetching, balancing efficiency and simplicity for static data while highlighting the trade-offs for dynamic datasets. Also conducted performance comparisons between MongoDB and CSV data fetching, balancing efficiency and simplicity for static data while highlighting the trade-offs for dynamic datasets. Seokha authored key sections of the project report and presentation, establishing a solid foundation for team collaboration and further refinement.
